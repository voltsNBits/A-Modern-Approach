a) "%d" is equivalent to " %d" 

    since both the instruction skips all whitespace 
    characters when looking for an integer output

b) "%d-%d-%d" is not equivalent to "%d -%d -%d"

    In the format "%d-%d-%d" each input integer should
    compulsory be followed by a - sign 

    But in the "%d -%d -%d" format any number of whitespace 
    characters can be entered in between the integers and 
    the - symbol
    
c) "%f" is not equivalent to "%f "

    In the format "%f" the scanf function is automatically
    terminated once the input is stored

    But in the "%f "  format even after the input is stored the scanf
    keeps on skipping whitespace character unless it comes across
    a non white space character

d) "%f,%f" is equivalent to "%f, %f"
