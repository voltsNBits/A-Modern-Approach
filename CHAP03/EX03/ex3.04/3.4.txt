When the input is given as 10.3 5 6

The output would be:
[
  The numbers are:10,0.300000,5
]
The scanf will first look for an integer therefore
  when it comes across '10.3' only the number 10 is stored 
  but puts back ' . ' since it does not match the requirements 
  for the format spectifier %d
After 10 is stored, .3 was put back and is read next for 
  the next format specifier %f and hence the number 0.3 is stored 
And finally the single digit 5 is stored when scanf looks
  for another integer usin %d, thus leaving the number 6 untouched
