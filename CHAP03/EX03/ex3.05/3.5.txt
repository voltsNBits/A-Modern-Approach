When the input is given as 12.3 45.6 789

The output would be:
[
  The numbers are:12.300000,45,0.600000
]
The scanf will first scan the input for a floating
  point integer and therefore the input 12.3 is stored
When scanf continues to find a suitable input for %d
  format specifier it comes across 45.6 and thus only 45 
  is stored And '.6' is put back for the next format scpecifer
