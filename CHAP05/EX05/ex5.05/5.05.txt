By using the command : gcc -Wbool-compare./ -std=c89 -o 5.06 5.06.c
We get the following warning message:
[
    5.06.c:9:12: warning: comparison of constant '10' with boolean 
        expression is always true [-Wbool-compare]
            if(n>=1<=10)
                   ^~
]
which says that the if condition will always be true for all 'n'
 Therefore the following 'if' statement is legal,
 however it doesn't behave as we expect
